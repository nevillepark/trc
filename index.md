The Executive Summary of [the findings of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission](http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=890), online in an easily readable format.

## About

The TRC report is a vital resource that weaves together survivors' testimony and historical records into a full account of how the Canadian government and religious institutions carried out cultural genocide against First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit people.

Currently the volumes are available in print and as e-books and PDFs. However, the full text has not yet been put online in a lightweight format that can be easily searched, navigated, and viewed on any device. The report is explicitly [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain), which means that the creators have waived copyright. Anyone can share it and put it in any format, for free.
