The Executive Summary of [the findings of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission](http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=890), online in an easily readable format.

## About

The TRC report is a vital resource that weaves together survivors' testimony and historical records into a full account of how the Canadian government and religious institutions carried out cultural genocide against First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit people.

The report is explicitly [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain), which means that the creators have waived copyright. Anyone can share it and put it in any format, for free. Currently the volumes are available in various formats, including [PDF](https://nctr.ca/records/reports/#trc-reports), [in print](https://www.mqup.ca/truth-and-reconciliation-commission-of-canada-comm-contributor-118863.php), as e-books (e. g. [Kindle](https://www.amazon.ca/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&field-author=Truth+and+Reconciliation+Commission+of+Canada&search-alias=books-ca), [OverDrive](https://toronto.overdrive.com/search/creatorId?query=999317&sortBy=newlyadded)), and [read aloud on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxPr_RIsvg9JJWoiRx2kl2v24r_pu7JbR).

However, the full text has not yet been put online in a lightweight, shareable format that can be easily searched, navigated, and viewed on any device.
