## About this site

The TRC report is a vital resource that weaves together survivors' testimony and historical records into a full account of how the Canadian government and religious institutions carried out cultural genocide against First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit people. 

Currently the volumes are available in print and as eBooks and PDFs. However, the full text has not yet been put online in a lightweight format that can be easily searched, navigated, and viewed on any device. The report is in the public domain, which means anyone can share it and put it in any format, for free.

I hope other people find this useful.
