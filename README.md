# The TRC Report Online

## About

The TRC report is a vital resource that weaves together survivors' testimony and historical records into a full account of how the Canadian government and religious institutions carried out cultural genocide against First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit people. 

Currently the volumes are available in print and as e-books and PDFs. However, the full text has not yet been put online in a lightweight format that can be easily searched, navigated, and viewed on any device. The report is explicitly [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain), which means that the creators have waived copyright. Anyone can share it and put it in any format, for free.

This is just the Executive Summary; the full report consists of several volumes. I am [documenting my steps](/trc/workflow) as I go in case anyone else wants to continue the work.

## Boring technical details

All of the tools I am using are free for anyone to use, and they (or reasonable equivalents) are included with free operating systems. Personally, I am using [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), which is based on the popular OS [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop).

### Command-line applications

- [```pdftotext```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdftotext)
- [```nano```](https://nano-editor.org/)
- [```tr```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr_(Unix)), [```sed```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed)
- and, of course, [```git```](http://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/14/non-programmer-git-intro/)

### Graphical applications

- [Regexr](http://regexr.com), as an [Epiphany](https://elementary.io/#showcase-epiphany) web app
- [markdown-toc](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/), to generate tables of contents
- PDF viewer [evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince)
- Text editor [Scratch](https://elementary.io/#showcase-scratch)

I could probably crowdfund buying the e-books and extract the text much easier that way, but I am stubborn and like a challenge.

At the moment the project is hosted on GitHub, though I'm considering GitBook/GitHub Pages/a small static stand-alone site. 

Suggestions, corrections, and feedback are welcome. Feel free to [contact me](https://nevillepark.ca/contact) or [create an issue](https://github.com/nevillepark/trc/issues), fork, pull request, etc.
